# Wedding Venue #
Our project ‘The Wedding Paradise’ is a website where people can book the venue or hall within a few minutes at any time from anywhere. 
They don’t have to waste their time in journeys and run from venue to venue to select it for their big day.

## Problem Analysis ##
In this present world,people are becoming more ambitious and busy in their daily life.So they want to make their life more easier and comfortable with technology. 
But booking a venue for their big day has become an irritating issue for people.They have to go to book the venue which is very time consuming and a waste of energy. 
Moreover, there is a limited time in which people have to go to book the venue.And if they don’t get that venue,they have to go to another place in search of the venue 
which is very tiring.That’s why we have tried to make a website where people can book their venue for their big day  from anywhere at anytime.

## Investigation ##
Last year,in my cousin’s wedding when we had to book the desired venue, we faced a lot of trouble. We travelled the whole dhaka city looking for a suitable venue. 
Most of the venues vacant dates were not matching with the date of my cousin’s wedding. And there were other problems too. We wasted a lot of time and days in 
search of the suitable venue. Then it came to my mind if there could be different websites of different venues,then we could book them on internet without wasting 
the time.For that,we tried for a website of a single venue.

## Environment and Sustainability ##
Our website is very sustainable socially and environmentally. There will be no need for extra employee for managing this website. For that any extra training 
of labour or human rights of labours will not be an issue for this project. Moreover it is very user friendly.So it will have a great impact on the people of 
our country in the future.And we don’t have many competitors in this field.So this website has a great future from our perspective as people are becoming more 
technology dependent.

## Project Management and Finance ##
Our project is a very low maintenance website.It doesn’t cost a very big amount and a group of two members is enough to build this project in a short time.


## Conclusion ## 
Our website is very practical and user friendly for people of all ages of our country.It is beneficial for our customers .
So we will try to make our project more user friendly for our people.
