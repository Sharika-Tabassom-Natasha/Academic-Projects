# PIXIE SMASHER #

Pixie smasher is kind of a fun game where we have tried to make the game on the basis of fairy tale.There are both good and evil pixies. We have to kill the evil pixies with the click of the mouse to protect the flowers and good pixies from them. Here pixies move in increasingly erratic patterns and at progressively faster speed. So it's a kind of a game of patience.
